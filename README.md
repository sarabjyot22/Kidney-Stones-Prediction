# 📌 Kidney Stones Prediction

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of kidney stone formation based on medical and lifestyle data. Machine learning models are trained to analyze various health indicators and provide predictions.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various features related to kidney stone prediction, including:

**Age** – Patient's age in years

**Gender** – Male or Female

**BMI** – Body Mass Index

**Calcium Levels** – Blood calcium concentration

**Oxalate Levels** – Oxalate concentration in urine

**Uric Acid** – Uric acid levels in the bloodstream

**pH** – Acidity or alkalinity of urine

**Water Intake** – Daily water consumption

**Dietary Habits** – Intake of oxalate-rich foods

**Family History** – Presence of kidney stones in family members
